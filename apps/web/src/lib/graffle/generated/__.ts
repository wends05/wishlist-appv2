// We import the global module for good measure although it is not clear it is always needed.
// It at least helps with Twoslash wherein without this import here Twoslash will not include the global module.
// In real TypeScript projects it seems the global module is included automatically. But there could be certain tsconfig
// setups where this still indeed does help.
